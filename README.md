# Racket iTunes Playlist Maker
## I developed an application in Racket that takes an iTunes library.xml file as input, and outputs multiple .txt files containing generated playlists. I used the built in racket/gui library for the user interface. The 2htdp library was used both for file writing and for converting the .xml file to a list of song tracks. My application outputs four different playlists.
