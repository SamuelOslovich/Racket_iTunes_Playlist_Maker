# Racket iTunes Playlist Maker
## I developed an application in Racket that takes an iTunes library.xml file as input, and outputs multiple .txt files containing generated playlists. I used the built in racket/gui library for the user interface. The 2htdp library was used both for file writing and for converting the .xml file to a list of song tracks. My application outputs four different playlists.

---

- Top Ten Playlist:  The top ten playlist is generated by taking the top ten most played songs in the .xml file
- Single Played Playlist:  The single played playlist is generated by taking all the songs that have only been played once in the .xml file.
- Random Playlist:  The random playist is generated by randomly picking each song in the .xml file, with a 25% chance for a song to be picked.
- Random Weighted Playlist:  The random weighted playlist is generated by randomly picking each song in the .xml with a weight being placed on how many plays the song has. The chance for a song to be picked starts at 50% chance for the most played song in the .xml file, and increases as the number of plays decreases.
